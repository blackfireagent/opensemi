This paradigm allows for dividing large SoC functions into smaller, reusable dies, integrated into a single system-in-package (SiP) to overcome traditional SoC scaling limits. Critical to this evolution are interconnect standards like UCIe and advanced packaging techniques (2.5D and 3D).

Unlike previous disturbances, ColumnDisturb can affect cells across multiple DRAM subarrays by repeatedly opening or keeping an aggressor row open, inducing bitflips in cells sharing the same columns. Experimental results from 216 DDR4 and 4 HBM2 chips show that this issue affects all major manufacturers and worsens as DRAM technology scales down, with the minimum time to induce a bitflip reducing by up to 5.06x. This trend suggests ColumnDisturb will pose significant challenges for future DRAM chips, impacting refresh mechanisms and data reliability.</p><p><img src="https://semiengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/AdobeStock_362074973-security-07-23-scaled.jpeg" alt="Security Image"></p><ul><li>A new “ColumnDisturb” read disturbance affects DRAM cells across multiple subarrays, causing bitflips.</li><li>This phenomenon worsens with DRAM technology scaling, reducing the time to induce bitflips by up to 5.06x.</li><li>ColumnDisturb poses significant reliability challenges for future DRAM designs and refresh mechanisms.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="Research"><a href="#Research" class="headerlink" title="Research"></a><a href="https://semiengineering.com/utilizing-chiplet-locality-for-efficient-memory-mapping-in-mcm-gpus-etri-sungkyunkwan-univ/">Research</a></h2><p><strong>Utilizing Chiplet-Locality For Efficient Memory Mapping In MCM GPUs (ETRI, Sungkyunkwan Univ.)</strong><br>Researchers from ETRI and Sungkyunkwan University have introduced CLAP (Chiplet-Locality Aware Paging), a novel approach to enhance memory mapping efficiency in Multi-Chip Module (MCM) GPUs. MCM designs introduce memory system non-uniformity when threads access remote chiplet resources, which is sensitive to page size. CLAP addresses this by determining the optimal page size for each application, leveraging the observation that GPU applications exhibit “chiplet-locality”—specific groups of pages primarily accessed by the same chiplet. By pre-organizing these local page groups into contiguous physical frames within the accessing chiplet, CLAP creates regions that function like large pages with merged TLB entries, delivering up to a 19.2% performance improvement over previous paging schemes.</p><p><img src="https://semiengineering.com/wp-content/uploads/AdobeStock_278047901-05-25-scaled.jpeg" alt="Adobe Stock Image"></p><ul><li>CLAP optimizes memory mapping in MCM GPUs by identifying and exploiting “chiplet-locality.”</li><li>It dynamically determines suitable page sizes for applications, consolidating local page groups for efficient access.</li><li>This approach improves performance by up to 19.2% by delivering the benefits of large pages without compromising locality.</li></ul><hr><h2 id="Insight"><a href="#Insight" class="headerlink" title="Insight"></a><a href="https://semiwiki.com/artificial-intelligence/362468-emulator-like-simulation-acceleration-on-gpus-innovation-in-verification/">Insight</a></h2><p><strong>Like Simulation Acceleration on GPUs.

(TSMC), the world’s leading semiconductor foundry, reported a remarkable financial performance for the July-September quarter. The company announced a record net profit of NT$452.3 billion ($15 billion), marking a nearly 40% year-on-year increase. This substantial surge in profitability is largely attributed to the unprecedented demand driven by the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. TSMC’s revenue also saw a significant 30% jump compared to the previous year, surpassing market expectations. The company continues to make substantial investments, including over $100 billion in the U.S. (with up to $40 billion at its new 300mm site in Sherman, Texas) and additional fabs in Japan, to ensure a geopolitically dependable and robust manufacturing capacity capable of meeting the “unyielding” global demand for its advanced semiconductor products, particularly those fueling the AI revolution.</p><p><img src="https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2025/taiwanese-chipmaker-ts.jpg" alt="TSMC Net Profit"></p><hr><h2 id="Research"><a href="#Research" class="headerlink" title="Research"></a><a href="https://www.semiconductor-digest.com/kaist-develops-an-ai-semiconductor-brain-combining-transformers-intelligence-and-mambas-efficiency/">Research</a></h2><p><strong>KAIST Develops an AI Semiconductor Brain Combining Transformer’s Intelligence and Mamba’s Efficiency</strong><br>A joint research team, spearheaded by Professor Jongse Park from KAIST School of Computing, in collaboration with Georgia Institute of Technology and Uppsala University, has achieved a significant breakthrough in AI semiconductor technology. They developed “PIMBA,” a core AI semiconductor “brain” based on a novel hybrid Transformer and Mamba structure. This innovative design is implemented as a Processing-in-Memory (PIM) system, enabling direct computation within the memory itself. PIMBA addresses the critical challenges of escalating computational loads and memory demands in Large Language Models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and Llama. By minimizing data movement, PIMBA demonstrated a remarkable 4.1-fold increase in LLM inference speed and an average 2.2-fold reduction in power consumption compared to existing GPU systems, promising a new era for energy-efficient, high-performance AI processing. This research is scheduled for presentation at the 58th International Symposium on Microarchitecture (MICRO 2025).</p><p><img src="https://scx2.b-cdn.net/gfx/news/hires/2025/semiconductor-brain-co.jpg" alt="KAIST PIMBA AI Semiconductor"></p><hr><h2 id="Insight"><a href="#Insight" class="headerlink" title="Insight"></a><a href="https://semiwiki.com/ceo-interviews/362391-ceo-interview-with-dr-bernie-malouin-founder-of-jetcool-and-vp-of-flex-liquid-cooling/">Insight</a></h2><p><strong>CEO Interview with Dr. Bernie Malouin Founder of JetCool and VP of Flex Liquid Cooling</strong><br>In a recent interview, Dr. Bernie Malouin, Founder of JetCool and VP of Flex Liquid Cooling, provided key insights into the escalating challenges of thermal management for AI and High-Performance Computing (HPC) workloads. Malouin emphasized that traditional air cooling systems are increasingly struggling to keep pace with the unprecedented heat generated by modern CPUs and GPUs, leading to significant power and thermal constraints in data centers. JetCool, now a part of Flex, specializes in advanced direct-to-chip SmartPlate™ liquid cooling technology, which boasts over 20% better performance than conventional solutions by precisely targeting hot spots on silicon.
