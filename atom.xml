A recent analysis highlights the direct contribution of electrons to these stochastic variations:</p><ul><li><strong>Electron Variability</strong>: Each absorbed EUV photon releases a random number of photoelectrons and subsequent secondary electrons, creating significant statistical fluctuations in energy deposition.</li><li><strong>Dose Limitations</strong>: Unlike classical photon shot noise, which decreases with increasing dose, electron noise exhibits an asymptotic limit. This means that at higher doses, electron noise becomes the dominant factor, severely limiting further improvements in stochastic behavior.</li><li><strong>Blurring and Defects</strong>: Electron scattering causes a blurring effect that reduces image contrast. Local fluctuations in electron density are more likely to cross printing thresholds, potentially leading to critical defects such as microbridging, especially along feature edges.</li><li><strong>Scaling Challenges</strong>: As feature sizes shrink to 10 nm half-pitch and below, pixel sizes decrease, resulting in fewer absorbed photons per pixel even with increased dose. This exacerbates both photon and electron noise, leading to higher probabilities of defect formation.</li></ul><p><img src="https://semiwiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/How-Secondary-Electrons-Worsen-EUV-Stochastics-1.jpg" alt="EUV Stochastic Image"></p><hr><p>Stay tuned for more cutting-edge developments and insights shaping the semiconductor landscape!</p>]]></content>
