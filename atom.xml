This growth is driven by both increased prices and demand, reflecting a strategic shift by major glass makers towards profitability after a decade of intense competition. Since 2022, prices have risen over 25% as companies manage production capacity and avoid new tank investments, focusing instead on efficiency. Chinese glass makers, however, continue aggressive investments, particularly in G8.5 glass tanks, and are expected to gain market share long-term.

Unlike previous disturbances, ColumnDisturb can affect cells across multiple DRAM subarrays by repeatedly opening or keeping an aggressor row open, inducing bitflips in cells sharing the same columns. Experimental results from 216 DDR4 and 4 HBM2 chips show that this issue affects all major manufacturers and worsens as DRAM technology scales down, with the minimum time to induce a bitflip reducing by up to 5.06x.

MCM designs introduce memory system non-uniformity when threads access remote chiplet resources, which is sensitive to page size. CLAP addresses this by determining the optimal page size for each application, leveraging the observation that GPU applications exhibit “chiplet-locality”—specific groups of pages primarily accessed by the same chiplet.

Each tier is meticulously optimized for specific requirements, such as high-performance logic, dense memory, or superior power efficiency, through advanced system-technology co-optimization (STCO). This innovative approach leverages 3D interconnects and backside power delivery networks (BSPDNs) to enable ultra-dense connections and power distribution on both sides of the wafer. At VLSI 2025, Imec showcased impressive advancements, including 250nm pitch wafer-to-wafer hybrid bonding and 120nm pitch through-dielectric vias (TDVs). These technologies facilitate sophisticated heterogeneous stacking and enhance power efficiency by drastically reducing IR drops and decongesting frontside interconnects, which is critical for future mobile SoCs and AI accelerators.</p><p><img src="https://semiwiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CMOS-2.0.jpg" alt="CMOS 2.0 is Advancing Semiconductor Scaling"></p><hr><h2 id="Insight"><a href="#Insight" class="headerlink" title="Insight"></a><a href="https://semiwiki.com/eda/synopsys/362661-the-rise-fall-and-rebirth-of-in-circuit-emulation-real-world-case-studies-part-2-of-2/">Insight</a></h2><p><strong>The Rise, Fall, and Rebirth of In-Circuit Emulation</strong><br>This in-depth article, featuring insights from Synopsys’s distinguished experts, chronicles the remarkable resurgence of in-circuit emulation (ICE) in system-level validation, largely driven by the evolution of third-generation speed adapters. Defying previous predictions of its obsolescence, modern ICE platforms, particularly those integrating Synopsys Speed Adapters and the System Validation Server (SVS), are proving indispensable for critical pre-silicon bug detection. Through compelling real-world case studies, the article demonstrates how high-fidelity ICE environments can uncover elusive RTL flaws, timing mismatches, and complex interoperability issues tied to low-level system behavior and physical layers (e.g., PCIe Gen5, UFS, Ethernet, MIPI sensors) that often escape virtual verification methods. By accurately simulating real-world operating conditions and rigorously enforcing design specifications, ICE significantly mitigates the risk of costly re-spins and accelerates time-to-tapeout, solidifying its role as an essential tool in the development of today’s increasingly complex semiconductor designs.</p><p><img src="https://semiwiki.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/The-Rise-Fall-and-Rebirth-of-In-Circuit-Emulation-real-world-case-studies-figure-1.png" alt="The Rise, Fall, and Rebirth of In-Circuit Emulation real world case studies figure 1"></p><hr><p>Stay connected for the latest innovations and breakthroughs shaping the future of the semiconductor industry!</p>]]></content>
